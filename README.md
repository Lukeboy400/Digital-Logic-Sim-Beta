# Digital Logic Sim

> Info
>> Digital Logic Sim is a project created by Sebastian Lague.
>> I am working on transferring DLS to python instead of C / C++.
>> My low-preformant device is not able to run DLS smoothly,
>> and that is the reason that I am using python.
>
> Instructions
>> For some reason all of the Github repos
>> provide instructiions that don't make sense
>> as a normal human. So hopefully I can provide
>> understantable instructions.
>>> Get the project in whatever way you choose.  
>>> Go into the `DLS_RG_TK` folder.
>>> Run the latest version (1.0.2)
>>> You're done!
>> I hope that was understandable.
